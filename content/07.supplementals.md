We looked at the ability for MAGs to predict subcellular localization of proteins using PSORTb. Overall, the localization distribution of predicted proteins were very similar in MAGs compared to the reference genome (Fig. (@fig:12subcellularLocalization)). Previous works have shown that AMR genes that are on mobile genetic elements disproportionally encode secrete proteins. Given that the recovery of plasmid-borne genes were not great, we asked if MAGs would affect the ability to predict the subcellular localization of proteins. We found that the proportion of predicted localizations were very similar between MAGs and our reference genomes, suggesting that there is not a significant penalty to use MAGs as input for protein localization predictions.
